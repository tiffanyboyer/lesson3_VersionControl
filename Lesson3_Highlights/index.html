            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Version Control System is a system to maintain and control edits to files without overriding past versions. These systems allow multiple users to make edits to files without hindering each other, and also helps the ease of use and organize everything better. It makes the edits visible to see who made them, why, what time, and keeps a history of all versions which makes it easy to follow the process and progress of a file. (VCS) </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository's purpose is to store the files & directories so that developers and their additional staff cam record changes made and track updates/status/versions. A repository is essentially a mechanism for encapsulating storage, retreival, and search behavior which emulates a collection of objects. And a repository does just that. In it's easiest definition, it's a central location in which data is stored and managed. It is a directory or storga space, for lack of a betetr definition. It can be a local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHUb or another online host. You can keep code files, text files, image files, anything inside this bad boy.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A remote repository is a repository that lives in a remote server that's shared amongst others on a team. This is where the Remote repository thrives. If you are on a team sharing data with your teammates, a remote repo comes into play and is very handy. It is essentially a "file server" that you use to exchange data with others. They are hosted on a server that is accessable for all team members- most likely on the internet or on a local network.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository is a repository that lives on a local machine of one particular user. There are two ways to create this. One: Create a brand new repository. Two: Clone an existing remote repository onto your local machine. These reside on the computers of team members. A local repo has a working copy associated with it: a directory where some of your project's files is checked out for you to work with. This is where a majority of work happens. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is distributed version control system. This control system allows every user with access to have a complete copy of the files located on the repositorythat's stored locally on their machine. Benefits of this include being able to work offline, no single point of failure, a much faster process, and prevents unintentional overwrite of a file on the shared repository. GIT is the software that runs the heart of GitHub. It is a software that helps manages changes to a project without overwriting any part of that project. It allows numerous people to work on a project at once without the fear of over writing others, and also gives you an option to merge.</p>
